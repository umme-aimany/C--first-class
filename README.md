# C++ First Class
this is a First class of c++

Welcome to your first class on C++ programming! In this class, we'll cover some fundamental concepts including variable, data types, and logical operators.

## Variable

A variable is a name given to a memory location, which stores data during the execution of a program. In C++, variables must be declared with a specific data type before they can be used. 

```cpp
int age; // Declaration of an integer variable
float price; // Declaration of a floating-point variable
char grade; // Declaration of a character variable
Data Types
C++ supports various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Each data type has a specific range and precision.int num = 10; // Integer data type
float value = 3.14; // Floating-point data type
char letter = 'A'; // Character data type
Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on operands. In C++, the logical operators include AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on operands. In C++, the logical operators include AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
